# Documentation and Examples for the Metadata of Synapse Images
## Video Synapse Outputs
- For every detected video, a folder with the same name will be created
- The folder contains the following
    - imgs subfolder: extracted images for each scene (currently 4 frames per scene)
    - scenes subfolder: each scene in an individual MKV-formatted video file
    - scenes.csv file: containing information about each scene
        - Line 1: Timecode List
            - The start timecode of each scene
            - Line 2 onwards: detailed scene information for each scene by the following order
                - Scene No.
                - Start frame
                - Start timecode
                - Start time in seconds (start from the i-th second)
                - End frame
                - End timecode
                - End time in seconds (end at the i-th second)
                - Length in the number of frames
                - Length in timecode
                - Length in the number of seconds
    - stats.csv file: PySceneDetect statistics output, helps with optimizing the detection parameters
    - synapse.json file: metadata for the synapse image
        - SourceType: whether it is generated from a video ("video") or a set of images ("stills")
        - ImageWidth: the width of the synapse image
        - NumberOfScenes: the number of scenes included in the synapse image
        - SceneStartFrameNumbers: the starting frame number of each scene
    - synapse.png file: The synapse image
## Stills Synapse Outputs
- For every folder containing stills image, a folder with the name `{foldername}_synapse` will be created
- The folder contains the following
    - synapse.json file: metadata for the synapse image
        - SourceType: whether it is generated from a video ("video") or a set of images ("stills")
        - ImageWidth: the width of the synapse image
        - NumberOfShots: how many shots (stills) are included in the synapse
        - ShotFileNames: the filenames (including directory name) of the included shots
    - synapse.png file: The synapse image
